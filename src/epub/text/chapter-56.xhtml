			<h2>LVI. <abbr>Mme.</abbr> Gaston to the Comtesse de L’Estorade</h2>
			<p>Ah! my dear friend, what can I say in answer except the cruel <i>“It is too late”</i> of that fool Lafayette to his royal master? Oh! my life, my sweet life, what physician will give it back to me. My own hand has dealt the deathblow. Alas! have I not been a mere will-o’-the-wisp, whose twinkling spark was fated to perish before it reached a flame? My eyes rain torrents of tears⁠—and yet they must not fall when I am with him. I fly to him, and he seeks me. My despair is all within. This torture Dante forgot to place in his <i>Inferno.</i> Come to see me die!</p>
